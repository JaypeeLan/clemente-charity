            programs and services for abandoned children. Donors can contribute
            in-kind donations such as clothing, toys, school supplies, and other

            Volunteer Opportunities: People can contribute their time and skills
            by volunteering at our residential homes or supporting our events
            and campaigns. Many companies offer matching gift programs where
            they match their employeesâ€™ donations. Donors can check if their
            employer has such a program and maximize their impact.

            Corporate Partnerships: Businesses can contribute through corporate
            sponsorships, cause-related marketing campaigns, or by implementing
            employee giving programs to support our organizations work.
            Individuals can organize their own fundraising events or participate
            in our organized events to raise funds and spread awareness about
            the cause
